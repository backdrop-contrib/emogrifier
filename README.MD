Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.

- Visit admin/config/content/formats or click on Configuration >> Content Authoring >> Text Format and Filters to set up a new input format, or add Emogrifier filtering to an existing format. 

- Within the format, you'll see the ability to configure Emogrifier under the filter list.
